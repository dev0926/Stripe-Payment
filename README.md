# Products Checkout using Stripe Payment

To run this project, you need to just run 'docker-compose up --build'.

If there is a problem with db, then you may wanna see properties setting in application.properties.

e.g.
`spring.flyway.baselineOnMigrate=true`

And api keys for Stripe is in code directly.

These are all test keys, so they are safe to be shared anywhere.

Thanks for checking my project.
