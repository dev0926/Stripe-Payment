# Products Checkout using Stripe Payment

To run this project, you need to just run 'docker-compose up --build'.

If there is a problem with db, then you may wanna see properties setting in application.properties.

e.g.
`spring.flyway.baselineOnMigrate=true`

And also I have added some more dependencies for spring boot and react.

You can see build.gradle and package.json to check packages.

And api keys for Stripe is in code directly.

These are all test keys, so they are safe to be shared anywhere.

Thanks for checking my project.
